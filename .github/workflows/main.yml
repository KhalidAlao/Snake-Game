            **Some issues couldn't be auto-fixed. Run these commands locally:**
            ```bash
            npm run format:write    # Fix formatting
            npm run lint:fix        # Fix auto-fixable lint issues
            ```
            
            **Then manually fix any remaining ESLint errors and run:**
            ```bash
            npm run lint            # Check for remaining issues
            ```
